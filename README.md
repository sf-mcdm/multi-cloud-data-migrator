## Key Features

- **‚Ü©Ô∏è Resumable Jobs:** Never lose your progress. If a migration is interrupted, click the **Resume Job** button to pick up right where it left off.
- **üß© Complex Relationship Handling:** Flawlessly handles objects linked by multiple fields (composite keys), complex lookups, and deep relationship hierarchies.
- **üå≥ Deep Clone Migration Plan (Revolutionary):** This feature provides precise control for migrating complex hierarchies from a single anchor point (Root ID). For Revenue Cloud Advanced products, inputting just the **Product SKU** enables our smart templates to automatically detect, gather, and correctly migrate the entire graph, including all dependencies (Price Rules, Attributes, Billing Policies) and dependents (Child Products, Classifications).
- **üìà High-Volume Performance:** Built with memory safeguards and the efficient Bulk API 2.0, the migrator processes millions of records in manageable chunks without crashing.
- **üìù Declarative & Reusable Plans:** Define your entire migration plan in a simple configuration file. This plan is reusable, version-controllable, and easy for your team to understand.
- **üéØ Flexible for Any Task:** Use a detailed config file for a full-scale migration (**Standard** tab), or use the **Custom Query** tab for a fast data seeding task.

## Configuration Concepts

The power of the migrator comes from its configuration file. This file defines the objects to migrate, their dependencies, queries, and relationship mappings. The order is crucial: dependencies must be migrated before the objects that rely on them.
