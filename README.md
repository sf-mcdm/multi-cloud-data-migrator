# Salesforce Multi-Cloud Data Migrator üöÄ

The **Salesforce Multi-Cloud Data Migrator** is a powerful and resilient command-line tool for migrating large, complex data volumes between Salesforce orgs.

It's built to handle the intricate data models found in **Revenue Cloud Advanced (`Product Catalog Management, Dynamic Revenue Orchestrator,...`), Revenue Cloud Billing, Digital Insurance, and other Salesforce Clouds**, allowing you to move entire datasets with confidence. Stop worrying about memory limits, manual LOOKUPs, or losing progress on failed jobs‚Äîthis tool handles it all.

> ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Data Quality Disclaimer
>
> Before starting **any** migration, it is critical to ensure your data is clean and properly prepared.
>
> - **Check Your Keys:** Use the **View Plan** button to review the migration strategy.
> - **Ensure Uniqueness:** Verify that all Key fields and composite key combinations are populated and **unique** in the source data.
> - **Validate Data:** Duplicate or missing keys will cause records to be skipped or linked incorrectly. The migration **will not run as expected** if the underlying data quality is poor.

## Key Features

- **‚Ü©Ô∏è Resumable Jobs:** Never lose your progress. If a migration is interrupted, click the **Resume Job** button to pick up right where it left off.
- **üß© Complex Relationship Handling:** Flawlessly handles objects linked by multiple fields (composite keys), complex lookups, and deep relationship hierarchies.
- **üå≥ Deep Clone Migration Plan (Revolutionary):** This feature provides precise control for migrating complex hierarchies from a single anchor point (Root ID). For Revenue Cloud Advanced products, inputting just the **Product SKU** enables our smart migration plans to automatically detect, gather, and correctly migrate the entire graph, including all dependencies (Price Rules, Attributes, Billing Policies) and dependents (Child Products, Classifications).
- **üìà High-Volume Performance:** Built with memory safeguards and the efficient Bulk API 2.0, the migrator processes millions of records in manageable chunks without crashing.
- **üìù Declarative & Reusable Plans:** Define your entire migration plan in a simple configuration file. This plan is reusable, version-controllable, and easy for your team to understand.
- **üéØ Flexible for Any Task:** Use a detailed config file for a full-scale migration (**Standard Migration Plans** tab), create your own (**Custom Migration Plans** tab), or use the **Custom Query** tab for a fast data seeding task.

## Migration Plan Concepts

The power of the migrator comes from its Migration Plan file. This file defines the objects to migrate, their dependencies, queries, and relationship mappings. The order is crucial: dependencies must be migrated before the objects that rely on them.
